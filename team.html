              <!-- <h2>The London Story</h2>
              <p>Investigate. Analyse. Protect.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The London Story was formed as an aftermath of the Indian citizenship struggle which saw one of the largest and longest-running continued social resistance in modern times. At The London Story, we strongly believe that citizenship is a tool through which majoritarian governments regularly create 'others’ who can be politically disenfranchised, dehumanized and socially reduced to margins. Our aim is to fight such dehumanization anywhere in the world by advocating for the rights of those who politically disenfranchised and are living in refugee, protracted refugee, and stateless conditions.</p> -->
            <h1>Board</h1>
            <p> <strong>Ms. Alokeparna Ray (Chairperson)</strong><br>Alokeparna Ray is a Social Rights Activist who has been actively engaged in organizing demonstrations, advocating for the rights of people who have been disenfranchised and put into detention centres in India, and channelizing support for families of victims of Delhi violence. She strongly believes in an inclusive society and wants political leaderships to be held accountable for acts of violence aimed at minority communities.  </p>
            <p> <strong>Dr. Ritumbra Manuvie (Treasurer)</strong><br>Dr. Manuvie is a lawyer by training and academic by choice. Her work lies at the cross-sectionality of public policy and intersectional marginality. She is an expert on construction of citizenship in rural and fragile ecosystems. Dr. Manuvie argues that street-bureaucracy regularly and systematically create statelessness – like the one we witnessed in Assam (India) – to evade their governance responsibility towards people who are most in need of assistance. She advocates for the need of detaching citizenship from governance action.</p>
            <p><strong>Mr. Shivam Maurya (Secretary) </strong><br>Shivam is a Data Scientist, who uses his tools for analysing big data to draw political and social trends that indicate rise of majoritarianism. As part of TLS he is engaged in developing opensource database of social and print media engagements which can determine the complicity of political leadership in inciting social raptures.</p>
