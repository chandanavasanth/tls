## Summary brief on The London Story
On 12th December 2019, the Government of India amended the Indian Citizenship Act, by adding that only people of non-Muslim religion who have entered India prior to 31st December 2015 will be eligible to apply
for Indian citizenship. This act came amid rising Islamophobia, and persistent declaration by the Indian Unionâ€™s Home Minister that an all-India National Citizenship Register would be prepared. Given a rocky
track-record of the governmentin preparation and implementation of the NRC in Assam, where 1.9 million residents of India were declared non-citizens overnight, there was a genuine fear that the all India NRC will be more devastating. NRC coupled with CAA would mean that any Muslim who has been excluded from the Citizenship register, would not have a standing to apply for Indian citizenship. The amendment led to
a nation-wide protest in India, and spilled over outside of India through Indian diaspora, which found its position and as minorities and migrant in European society similar to those of minorities in India.

All across Europe between the month of December and February over 70 protests and demonstrations were held. These were often coupled with teach-ins and lectures on Indian constitution, secularism and
construction of citizenship. Every protest was held from a knowledge grounding and led by engaged academics and highly skilled professionals working across Europe. The European solidarity networks were solidifying themselves with over 10,000 participation in the protests and teach-ins. On 29th of February following the Delhi riot over 20 citiescametogether amidst corona virus lockdown in a demonstration. The follow-up to this collective demonstration saw several cross-country comfort calls made over the context of Delhi riot to check on fellow protestors and their well-being. The 29th February event once on social media, started seeing more and more cities, people and groups joining in. We were joined by socialist networks, anti-fascism protestors, students for climate, feminist networks and we became a social movement!

Over the past 20 weeks, we have been actively focusing on:
 - Demonstration
 - Advocacy & Policy
 - Relief
 - Digital Campaigns
