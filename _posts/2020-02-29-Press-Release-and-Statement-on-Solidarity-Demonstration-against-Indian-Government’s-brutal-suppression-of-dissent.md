**Press Release and Statement on Solidarity Demonstration against Indian Government&#39;s brutal suppression of dissent.**

- The Union Government of India has enacted the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which came into force on 10th January 2020. We believe that this law is clearly irrational and discriminatory as it fails to provide shelter to the persecuted in Sri Lanka as well as turning a blind eye towards Muslims victimised by state oppression in other countries as is clearly in the case of Ahmadiyyas in Pakistan and Rohingyas in Myanmar. Thus, the CAA is in contravention of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian constitution which clearly upholds the equality of an individual before the law within India and the fundamental right of a person to live with dignity. The law is in shameful violation of the secular fabric of the Constitution which forbids any discrimination based on religion, caste, class and gender.

- Deliberate confusion has been spread by senior leaders of the Union Government on the National Register of Citizens (NRC) throughout the country. Previously the chronology of the CAA-NRC combined scheme was publicly explained by the Home Minister himself. However, in the face of intense protests, the Home Ministry is retracing its steps by saying that no decision has been made until now on the implementation of nationwide NRC. If implemented, NRC will force the common people to prove their citizenship before the state authorities or otherwise face indefinite detention at special detention centres which are being built across the country. We believe that the CAA in conjugation with NRC linked with National population register (NPR) is designed to divide the country on communal lines and force immense hardships on the economically marginalised sections of the population along with other minorities with the sole purpose of promoting chauvinism and bigotry by the Government under the influence of proponents of militant Hindutva.

- The Government has given a free hand to the police and other security personnel in using violence and coercion to silence protesters in Assam, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. Particularly protesting students and women have been systematic targets of vindictive actions taken by the Union Government which include imposition of section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), detentions, outright vandalising, lock down of public services and suspension of internet in various parts of the country, charging protesters on grounds of sedition and others. This has deprived the citizens of their right to peacefully raise objections guaranteed by Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The situation is worsened by hate mongering and divisive rhetoric practised by the RSS and its other affiliates and the systematic failure of the Union Government to condemn and prevent such activity. The recent onslaught of the hindutva brigade directed at the protesting citizens on 23rd and 24th February in Delhi and Aligarh is a prime example.

- We fear that the current aggressive push for CAA-NRC scheme and fostering of communal tensions is just a diversionary tactic used by the present Government to steer around the concerns rising from the state of general economic decline in India and to drive the public gaze away from real questions of growth and development.

**Indians from various parts of Europe and any other conscious individuals sympathetic to the cause will gather peacefully on 13th and 14th March outside the EU Parliament to reach out to the public and the visiting Indian Prime Minister to voice their dissent and demand the following:**

1) The Union Government of India should immediately repeal CAA of 2019 along with scrapping of the NRC scheme to protect the secular and humanitarian ethos of the Indian Constitution.

2) We stand in solidarity with students of various universities and colleges, the brave women of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, Clock Tower in Lucknow and Park Circus in Kolkata, the protests at the Gateway of India in Mumbai and in various different places, the workers and peasants and all others in India in their struggle against the communal agenda of the CAA-NRC-NPR scheme and appeal to all democratic and secular forces across the world to show support for the movement against CAA-NRC. Therefore, we urge the Parliament of the European Union to show commitment towards the common principles of democracy and human rights shared by all citizens of the world by unequivocally condemning the CAA of 2019 passed by the Indian Government along with the plans of implementation of NRC in the form of a resolution against it.

3) The Union Government of India should condemn the violence perpetrated against protesters all across the country and set up an independent enquiry to investigate the atrocities committed by police personnel as well as violence by extremist organisations against protesting citizens and bring them swiftly to justice thereby discouraging any such future course of action.

4) The Union Government of India should immediately repeal section 144 and stop suspension of internet, curfews and other disruptions of communications across the country (particularly in Jammu and Kashmir).

5) The Union Government of India should refrain from the use of force against the protesters and show commitment towards working out a peaceful resolve of any dissent in a democratic atmosphere in line with the constitution of the nation.
 
6) The Union Government of India should focus on the economic development of the nation and provide ample financial opportunities for the upliftment of the marginalised sections of the society.
