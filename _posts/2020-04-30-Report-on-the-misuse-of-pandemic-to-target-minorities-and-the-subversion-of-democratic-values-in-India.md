## Report on the misuse of pandemic to target minorities and
the subversion of democratic values in India

While governments all over the world are fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, Modi government is using the opportunity created by the lock-down for continued systemic vilification of minorities (especially
Muslims), and for targeting dissidents. The pandemic has been used to demonise Muslims and scapegoat them for the calamity. This has intensified the continued dehumanization of Muslims in India.



Another concern is the use of UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act), which was originally and ostensibly introduced to fight terrorism, but is now being used to divest citizens of their fundamental
rights. People are being picked up and put in jails under flimsy presences and fictitious cases, and being held without trial for long periods of time using provisions of UAPA. Intellectuals, journalists and whistleblowers
who are leading the defence of pluralism and democracy are being systematically targeted. In this report we focus on theongoing persecution and its intensification during the pandemic.
